**Exploratory Data Analysis of Geolocational Data**
This project involves the exploration and analysis of geolocational data using Python. The primary objective is to perform an in-depth analysis of location-based data, providing insights into geographical patterns. The project also integrates machine learning to perform clustering using the K-Means algorithm, and the Foursquare API is used for accessing live geolocational data.

**Project Overview**
This project aims to:
  Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on geolocational data.
  Use the K-Means clustering algorithm to group similar locations.
  Visualize the geospatial data and clusters.
  Integrate the Foursquare API to obtain live geolocational data for real-time analysis.

**Key Features**
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncover trends, patterns, and outliers in geolocational data.
2. K-Means Clustering: Group similar locations based on geospatial features.
3. Foursquare API Integration: Fetch live location data to make the analysis dynamic and real-time.
